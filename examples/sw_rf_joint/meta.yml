title: Surface wave dispersion and receiver function (joint inversion)
application domain: CoFI Examples -> EARTH SCIENCES -> Geophysics -> Seismology and seismic exploration -> Joint inversion -> Surface wave dispersion and receiver function
description: We utlise CoFI to run optimsiation, fixed-dimensional sampling and trans-dimensional sampling on a joint inversion problem of surface wave dispersion and receiver function
method:

    description: We jointly invert receiver-function and surface-wave velocity measurements for the 1-D Vs structure using different approaches: optimisation, fixed-dimensional sampling, and trans-dimensional sampling
    methods:
      - CoFI -> Parameter estimation -> Optimization -> Non linear -> scipy.optimize.minimize -> trust-exact
      - CoFI -> Ensemble methods -> Bayesian sampling -> McMC samplers -> emcee -> StretchMove
      - CoFI -> Ensemble methods -> Bayesian sampling -> Trans-D McMC -> bayesbay -> VanillaSampler
